# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to identify and classify malicious activities and network intrusions. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic patterns, detect abnormal behaviors, and classify them into predefined attack categories or benign traffic.

## Features

- **Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze and detect suspicious activities in real-time.
- **AI/ML-Based Detection**: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Neural Networks for anomaly detection.
- **Predefined Attack Classification**: Supports classification into different attack types (e.g., DoS, DDoS, Port Scanning, Brute Force).
- **Customizable Model**: Train the system with your own dataset to enhance detection capabilities.
- **Alert Generation**: Generate alerts when an anomaly or intrusion is detected in the network traffic.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Network Analysis Libraries**: Scapy, PyShark
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-network-intrusion-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ai-network-intrusion-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The system can be trained using publicly available datasets, such as:

- **KDD Cup 1999 Dataset**: A dataset containing various types of network attacks and normal traffic.
- **CICIDS 2017 Dataset**: A dataset that includes labeled network traffic for identifying attacks.

You can also use your own network traffic dataset to train the model.

## Model Evaluation

The system's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

You can modify the evaluation parameters or select different metrics as per your requirement.
